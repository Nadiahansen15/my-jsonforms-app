    "description": "Workloads, landing zones and projects are often used interchangeably. However, a workload (the actual services and resources such as VMs, databases etc.) is contained within a landing zone. A landing zone (the subscription containing the services and resources) is deployed through a DevOps project.",

    "note": "Before deleting a landing zone (the subscriptions and their content) it is important to know whether any data should be backed up. Are there any databases, recovery vaults etc. that might be needed at some point? If so, where should these resources be moved to and who should have access to them?",
